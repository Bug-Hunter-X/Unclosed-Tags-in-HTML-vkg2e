<p>This is an example of a common HTML error: using a closing tag for an element that doesn't require one, like <code><br></code> or <code><img></code>.</p><code><br></code><p>The <code><br></code> tag is a self-closing tag. Adding a closing tag like <code></br></code> is incorrect and can lead to unexpected rendering issues in some browsers. This particular error is quite common because many beginners and intermediate-level developers are initially unaware of self-closing tags.  While many modern browsers tolerate it without throwing errors, the code will not conform to standard HTML, potentially causing conflicts with stricter validation or future browser updates.</p><code><img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image"></img></code><p>The <code><img></code> tag is also a self-closing tag. A closing tag here is similarly redundant and incorrect.</p>
